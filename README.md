A static web page for an application built with only HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This project uses a data-set as an input list turn it to a sorted one according to the first word in the entries.

Try the live demo [right here](https://rashaali84.github.io/Sort-Without-Articles/index.html), it looks something like this:

## Notes

Studying this project we learned about:

- Dynamically sorting arrays using .sort() .
- Using arrow functions => for fewer code of lines instead of call back
  functions .
- How the query selector is used to access the dom .
- using the regular expressions in replacing parts of a tring and also using trim()
  to remove the space from the input string ( form begining and from the end).
- How milestones, labels & issues can help organize work ->
  - user stories === milestones
  - tasks === issues
  - labels === what type of task it is

We struggled with:

- How to create the development strategy. and how to divide projects into organized folders .
- We kept having conflicts in merging branches .
- Keeping tracks of all forks and keep them updates with the original repository.
