# Sort without Articles ( to be done yet !! )

A static web page for rhythmic expression built with only HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This project uses .wav audio files and keypress events to turn the user's keyboard into a drum set.

Try the live demo [right here](https://hackyourfuture.be/drum-kit), it looks something like this:

## Notes

Studying this project we learned about:

- Dynamically setting classes
- Using the `<audio>` tag and .wav assets
- How the query selector can be used to easily interact with many elements
- How milestones, labels & issues can help organize work ->
  - user stories === milestones
  - tasks === issues
  - labels === what type of task it is

We struggled with:

- How to create the development strategy. It was tricky to figure out that the `playHandler` can actually work without changing the `.played` class, once that was clear it was easier to create the _Keys Light Up_ user story.
- We kept making mistakes with the `data-key` attributes and linking the wrong keys and sounds.
- Merge Conflicts! whoever invented these has no soul
- Keeping track of all the branches and forks. OMG, github is confusing
